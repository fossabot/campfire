# Contributing

There is not much code in the parent repository.
Thus, there is only one branch
which is master.

Some ways to contribute:
- Updating submodules (preferably master branch)
- Fixing names (variables, files, etc.)
- Adding features
- Writing/Fixing comments
- Fixing bugs
- Fixing text errors (grammar, license error, etc.)
